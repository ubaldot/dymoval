The model validation process happens in four steps:

#. **Design a Set of Experiments**: Define a set of experiments to be carried
   out on the target environment. This involves specifying the set of stimuli
   (*input*) to be applied on the target environment. Such a task is also
   known as the :ref:`doe`.

#. **Execute** the experiments planned in step 1. on the target environment
   and **collect** the response. The combination of the input signals and the
   system response is referred to as the *measurement dataset* (or simply
   dataset). Due to sensors may be noisy, sampled at different rate, log
   intermittently, etc., you may need to :ref:`clean-up your measurements
   dataset <create_dataset>`.

#. **Generate Simulation Data**: Conduct the exact same experiments defined in
   step 1 on the model and :ref:`log its response <simulate_model>` and
   collect its response. Such a response is referred to as the simulation
   results.

#. **Evaluate the Results**: :ref:`Assess <validation_session>` how "close"
   the simulation results from step 3. are to the logged responses from step
   2. using specific validation metrics.

   The model validation process.  In this picture the validation method only
   returns a pass/fail value but in general it returns the evaluation of some
   model quality metrics.

If the results of step 4. are good, then you can trust what your model says
within is validation region.

Let's see how steps 1-4 can be applied.

   **Example**

   Assume that you are developing some cool autonomous driving algorithm that
   shall be deployed in a car, which represent your *target environment*.

   Assume that your car model consider the following signals:

   #. *accelerator pedal position*,
   #. *steering wheel position* and
   #. *road profile*,

   as **inputs**, and the following signals:

   #. *longitudinal speed* and
   #. *lateral speed*.

   as **outputs**.

   Next, you want to validate your model.

   Steps 1-4 are carried out in the following way:

   #. **Design of Experiment (DoE)**: Choose a driving route with sufficient
      road slope variation. Plan to take a ride on that path with a
      challenging driving style, including sudden accelerations and abrupt
      steering movements. Congratulations! You have just created a Design of
      Experiment (DoE).

   #. **Data Collection:** Take a ride according to the plan. Log the input
      signals (i.e., the accelerator pedal position, the steering wheel
      position, and the road profile time-series) along with the output
      signals (i.e., longitudinal and lateral speed time-series) of the
      vehicle while driving. These logs represent your measurements dataset.
      Note how input and output are separated.

   #. **Model Simulation:** Feed your model with the input signals from the
      measurements dataset and log your model's output corresponding to the
      longitudinal and lateral vehicle speed dynamics, for which you also have
      the measurements data.

   #. **Comparison and Validation:** Compare the longitudinal and lateral
      vehicle speed time-series logged during the actual drive with the
      simulated results using specific validation metrics.

   You haven' finished yet. In-fact, when you develop and validate a model,
   you should also consider the coverage region of the model along with the
   validation results.

   If you logged data only in the *accelerator pedal position* range [0,40] %,
   the *steering angle* in the range [-2,2]Â° and the *road profile was flat*
   for all the time, then you have to deliver such an information along with
   your model to a potential model user.

The cost savings when using models are clear, but there is no free lunch. In
fact, the challenge lies in the design of good models.
