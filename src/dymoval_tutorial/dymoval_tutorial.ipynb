    "### Validation setup\n",
    "To validate our model we need to verify that its response is as close as possible to the actual DC motor response in front of the same *input* signal. Therefore, we need some **log data** and some **simulation data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that we get some logs from the labs where a team run some experiments and collected the results in a `HDF5` file and that another team developed a DC motor model. Although such a team could also simulate the model by feeding it with the log data and provide us with just the simulation results, in this example we simulate the model by ourselves.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Note 1\n",
    "Dymoval is build to simplify common tasks that an engineer has to carry out and who may find tools such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc. a bit too overwhelming.\n",
    "However, if you need more power, consider that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every plot returns a *matplotlib* figure, which means that you can further manipulate such a figure through the *matplotlib* API.\n",
    "2. If you need to do further manipulate youd dataset and *dymoval* won't provide you certain functionalities, the you can use the method `dump_to_signals()` to dump the all the signals stored in the `Dataset` instance into a list of `Signals`. At this point you could use any packages you want (e.g. *numpy*, *scipy*, etc.) to manipulate the signals and then you may want to instantiate a brand new `Dataset` object from the manipulated signals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note 2\n",
    "When manipulating `Dataset` or `ValidationSession` object, Dymoval won't change the current instance, but it returns a modified copy of it.\n",
    "This means that e.g. `ds.remove_means()` won't change `ds` but you should explicitely re-assign it, e.g. `ds = ds.remove_means()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note 3\n",
    "The main objects of *dymoval* are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Signals, \n",
    "2. Datasets and \n",
    "3. ValidationSessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Signals` are used as entry point from the external world to *dymoval*. We tried to keep them be as generic as possible.\n",
    "`Datasets` are built upon *pandas* `DataFrames`. In-fact, the attribute `Dataset.dataset` is a pandas `DataFrame`:"
