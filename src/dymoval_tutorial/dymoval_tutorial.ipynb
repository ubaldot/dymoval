    "## DC Motor model\n",
    "We assume that we built the model of a DC electric motor that we want to validate. The motor is assumed to be connected to a constant load.\n",

    "### Validation setup\n",
    "To validate our model we need to verify that its response is as close as possible to the actual DC motor response in front of the same *input* signal. Therefore, we need to log some **measurement data** and use them to stimulate our model, thus generating some **simulation data**. Both measurements and simulation data serve as inputs to Dymoval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we assume that we get some measurements logs from the labs where a team run some experiments and collected the results in a `HDF5` file and that another team developed a DC motor model. Although the latter team could also simulate the model by feeding it with the log data and provide us with just the simulation results, in this example we assume that they just provide a model but we need to simulate it by ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Log data analysis\n",
    "The first step is to extract the logs from the `HDF5` file and build a *dymoval* Dataset object but before doing that let's start by importing some useful packages:"

    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, you can consider the following rule of thumbs: you want the r-squared index as high as possible and the residuals auto-correlation as close as possible to 1 and the input-residuals cross-correlation as small as possible. If that happens, then your model is good to go in its coverage region. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the default way the residuals auto-correlation and input-residuals cross-correlation are computed consider the *l-infinity norm* for each scalar signal with respect to the number of lags. The result after such an operation is a *p x q* matrix and the \"2-norm\" is computed on such a matrix. \n",
    "You may consider to change both the norms or to further manipulate them: for example you can normalize the l-norm if you replace the *l-infinity norm* with the *l-2 norm* or divide by *p x q* the result of the Matrix norm. \n",

    "#### Note 1\n",
    "Dymoval is build to simplify common tasks that an engineer has to carry out and who may find tools such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc. a bit too overwhelming.\n",
    "However, if you need more power, consider that\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every plot returns a *matplotlib* figure, which means that you can further manipulate such a figure through the *matplotlib* API.\n",
    "2. If you need to do further manipulate youd dataset and *dymoval* won't provide you certain functionalities, the you can use the method `dump_to_signals()` to dump the all the signals stored in the `Dataset` instance into a list of `Signals`. At this point you could use any packages you want (e.g. *numpy*, *scipy*, etc.) to manipulate the signals and then you may want to instantiate a brand new `Dataset` object from the manipulated signals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note 2\n",
    "When manipulating `Dataset` or `ValidationSession` object, Dymoval won't change the current instance, but it returns a modified copy of it.\n",
    "This means that e.g. `ds.remove_means()` won't change `ds` but you should explicitely re-assign it, e.g. `ds = ds.remove_means()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note 3\n",
    "The main objects of *dymoval* are \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Signals, \n",
    "2. Datasets and \n",
    "3. ValidationSessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Signals` are used as entry point from the external world to *dymoval*. We tried to keep them be as generic as possible.\n",
    "`Datasets` are built upon *pandas* `DataFrames`. In-fact, the attribute `Dataset.dataset` is a pandas `DataFrame`:"

Therefore, you may use the `dump_to_signals()` method as described in the **Note 1**, manipulate your signals and then create a new `Dataset` object.\n",
