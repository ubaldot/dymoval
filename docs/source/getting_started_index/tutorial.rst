Tutorial
========

Now that you learned what is meant with model validation you can play around with *Dymoval*.
The best way to take familiarity with *Dymoval* is to run any tutorial by typing

.. code-block::

    import dymoval as dmv
    dmv.open_tutorial()

Create a `dymoval_tutorial` folder containing all the files needed to
run the tutorial. All you have to do is to run Jupyter notebook named
`dymoval_tutorial.ipynb`. You need an app for opening `.ipynb` files.

The content of the `dymoval_tutorial` folder will be overwritten every time this function is
called.
